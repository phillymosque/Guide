# 
# If you can keep your head when all about you 
# Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
# If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
# But make allowance for their doubting too;
# If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
# Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
# Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
# And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:
# 
# If you can dream - and not make dreams your master;
# If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim;
# If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
# And treat those two impostors just the same;
# If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
# Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
# Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
# And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools: 
# 
# If you can make one heap of all your winnings 
# And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
# And lose, and start again at your beginnings
# And never breathe a word about your loss;
# If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
# To serve your turn long after they are gone,
# And so hold on when there is nothing in you
# Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'
# 
# If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
# Or walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch,
# If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
# If all men count with you, but none too much;
# If you can fill the unforgiving minute
# With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
# Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
# And - which is more - you'll be a Man, my son!
# 
#                                  - Rudyard Kipling
